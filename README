Hello, this is my first "major" project in C++ non-related to academic work
It is supposed to be a Snake Game copy with possibility of playing in multiplayer

/* GENERAL TODO:
* Add Main Menu
* Add functionality for playing via network
* Add ability to modify colours (maybe adding textures, more advanced visuals)
* Make gameplay non-dependent on refresh rate
* LOW-PRIO TODO:
* Sounds
* Unit Tests
* More levels, more complexity (adding walls, enemies with AI, etc.)
